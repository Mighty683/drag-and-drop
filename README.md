# Done:

- Use React DND kit (no mobile support for DnD api)
- Optimize building slots
- Reduce complexity of slots building to linear?
  - Can we make it work without sorting? - No it solves a lot of problems with
    building events nodes
- Refactor and simplify grid building
- Grouping events over 3 elements in row

# TODO:
